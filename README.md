Now, simply install all the necessary angular packages into your current project using the `npm install` command and run your project using the ng serve command

## Features and Benefits

### Filtering

Built-in member function and Excel-like filters with advanced filtering options can be used to filter and view data as required. It is also possible to filter data programmatically in the Pivot Table.

### Pivot Chart

The Angular Pivot Chart can easily be integrated with pivot data rendered independently and includes support for plotting more than 20 chart types. The end-user experience is greatly enhanced with a set of user-interaction features such as drill up, drill down, zoom, pan, crosshair, trackball, events, selection, and tooltip. Highly interactive field list options are available for generating reports from the relational data dynamically.

### Virtual scrolling

Large amounts of data can be divided and displayed in the rows and columns of the current viewport using the virtual scrolling feature. You can navigate to a desired view by scrolling the vertical and horizontal scrollbars.

### Paging

Large amounts of data can be divided and displayed page by page with the paging feature. The pager UI allows you to navigate to a desired page using the navigation buttons or an input text box. You can change the row and column page sizes independently at runtime. Furthermore, you can toggle the position of the row and column pagers, modify their visibility, and visualize them using a compact view mode.

### Pivot Table field list and group fields

The Angular Pivot Table [field list](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/pivotview/field-list?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=angular-pivot-table-github-samples) and [group fields](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/pivotview/grouping-bar?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=angular-pivot-table-github-samples) options are automatically populated with fields from the bound data source. They allow end users to drag, filter, and sort fields, as well as create pivot reports at runtime.
